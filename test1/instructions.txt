In your Ubuntu terminal, enter the following commands:

sudo apt-get install curl
sudo apt-get install golang-go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo apt-get install python
sudo apt-get install docker
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
sudo apt-get update
apt-cache policy docker-ce
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
sudo apt-get install docker-compose
sudo apt-get upgrade

With that, our environment is set up.

Next, we're going to download the samples of Fabric that have already been prepared to test it out. Enter the following two commands in your terminal. 

sudo curl -sSL https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 | sudo bash -s 1.1.0
sudo chmod 777 -R fabric-samples

So now we have the samples. 

We're going to make sure that everything runs by running our first network. Change into the first-network directory and run the generate script that will create the certificates and keys for the entities that are going to exist on our blockchain. This will also create the genesis block (the first block on the blockchain), among other things.

cd fabric-samples/first-network
sudo ./byfn.sh generate

Now bring the blockchain network up with the following command.

sudo ./byfn.sh up

If everything worked, then you successfully created your first Fabric network! Congratulations. Let's bring it down for now.

sudo ./byfn.sh down

Okay, so we know our computer can successfully use and deploy Hyperledger Fabric blockchain networks, but what now?
